# Taskmaster Client

Client for Takmaster App. 

On the frontend, Taskmaster is powered by `React`, `Vite`, and `Tailwind CSS`, complemented by various other libraries for a seamless user experience.

The primary focus during development was to meticulously replicate the UI of the Microsoft To-Do app, striving for a seamless resemblance. Furthermore, Taskmaster is designed to be fully responsive, making it accessible and functional on any device seemlessly.
